# CPU Chaste Chess

## A small tool for creating Chess videos

â€‹Chaste Chess is a tool that anyone can use to make videos of a standard Chess game. A human simply plays both sides from the starting position by clicking the pieces and the squares they move to. When done, press escape and then an animation of the moves you made will play back. You can restart it from the beginning by pressing the R key. You can use OBS-Studio or any screen capture software to record the game as it plays.

I made this tool for my own use to make short videos of my favorite Chess opening lines. It is ready to be used by anybody, but future updates may include updates to the performance or fixing errors that are detected.

CPU Chaste Chess is the updated version of my game, Chaste Chess, that goes back to using Software Surfaces which are processed with the Central Processing Unit rather than the Graphics Processing Unit. This was written because I wanted it to be compatible with even older systems which do not support the hardware accelerated graphics methods present in SDL version 2.
